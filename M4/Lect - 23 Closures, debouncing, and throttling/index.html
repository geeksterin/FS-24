    whenever user type a char will schedule a backend a call known as A. 
        A is going to be invoked after 500ms 
            DONE

            now in between 500ms if user types another char then will cancel out A (previous call) and will schedule a fresh call backend known as B.
                B is going to be invoked after 500ms from here.

    Ex:
        users type a char 'c' at time 0ms
            we schedule a backend a call known as A which is going to be invoked after 500ms.
                but at 200ms user types another char 'g' so now pervous scheduled backend call will canceled and will reshcudle a newer one which will be called at 700ms.

    Debouncing: we are secheduling a fresh new evening and canceling a prevously scheduled event.

    Throttling: we are not scheduling a fresh new event but just limiting the rate of calling a backend.
    Ex:
        Users type a char 'c' at time 0ms
            we schedule a backend a call known as A which is going to be invoked after 500ms.
                but at 200ms user types another char 'g' so we will not cancel previous scheduled event also will not sechule new event.

            at time 700ms if user clicks i
